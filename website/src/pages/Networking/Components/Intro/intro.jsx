        <h1>Networking & Communications</h1>
        <p>
        While pursuing my AAS in Cybersecurity, I gained a solid foundation in networking, including how data moves through the OSI and TCP/IP models. I can configure IP addressing and subnetting, manage routers and switches, and apply concepts like VLANs, NAT, and ACLs to control and secure traffic. I'm familiar with protocols such as DNS, DHCP, FTP, SSH, SNMP, and HTTP/S, and can diagram topologies like mesh, star, and hub-and-spoke.
